The agents can define a set of actions like tagging a conversation with a label, sending an email transcript, updating a custom attribute, etc., and they can run these actions in a single click. When the agents run the macro, the actions would be performed sequentially in the order they are defined. Macros improve productivity and increase consistency in actions. </p><p>A macro can be helpful in 2 ways. </p><p><b>As an agent assist:</b> If an agent performs a set of actions multiple times, they can save it as a macro and execute all the actions together using a single click.</p><p><b>As an option to onboard a team member:</b> Every agent has to perform many different checks/actions during each conversation. Onboarding a new support team member will be easy if pre-defined macros are available on the account. Instead of describing each step in detail, the manager/team lead can point to the macros used in different scenarios.</p>"
